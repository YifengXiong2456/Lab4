# Fried Rice

## Ingredents

- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 medium scallions
- 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided
- 1 cup frozen peas and carrots (do not thaw)
- 4 cups cold cooked brown or white rice (see Recipe Notes), preferably medium grain
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
- 3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more as needed
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

## Cooking Steps

1. Cook your veg. Stir-fry garlic, scallion whites, peas, and carrots in a large wok or nonstick frying pan. 
2. Add the rice. Make sure to break up any clumps, toss to combine, and add your seasonings.
3. Scramble the eggs. Push the fried rice to one side of the pan, then add your eggs to the other side. The eggs are scrambled in the pan while they’re getting slowly cooked, and then folded into the fried rice to finish. (This technique is used in a lot of stir-fries and dry noodle dishes, and it’s really fun to do too!)
4. Finish the fried rice. Drizzle with sesame oil and garnish with scallion greens.

## Cooking Tips

**Fried rice will last for up to four days in the fridge, and up to a month in the freezer. Feel free to reheat in the microwave, or heat over the stovetop in a pan until it’s ready. Another great thing about fried rice is that even after reheating it, it’ll taste just as good!**
